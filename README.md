A mod that makes /give better.

Currently this is v0.9. I'm an absolute rookie, learned yesterday Java with ChatGPT and reading Fabric docs. All help appreciated.
v1 will add a menu where after selecting an item in /give, shows you a little menu where you can chose an enchant and durabilityn and the value. 
After adding one of those, add a + to bring the menu back and add another enchant for example.
